	"description": "An unbiased non-linear average of multiple subjects from the MNI152 database, which provides high-spatial resolution and signal-to-noise while not being biased towards a single brain (Fonov et al., 2011). This template space is widely used as a reference space in neuroimaging. HBP provides the JuBrain probabilistic cytoarchitectonic atlas (Amunts/Zilles, 2015) as well as a probabilistic atlas of large fibre bundles (Guevara, Mangin et al., 2017) in this space.",

			"description": "A number of unbiased non-linear averages of the MNI152 database have been generated that combines the attractions of both high-spatial resolution and signal-to-noise while not being subject to the vagaries of any single brain (Fonov et al., 2011). The procedure involved multiple iterations of a process where, at each iteration, individual native MRIs were non-linearly fitted to the average template from the previous iteration, beginning with the MNI152 linear template.",
